How to quickly generate test conversations:
===========================================

Ensure that your D-BUS is set up correctly, by either sourcing
/tmp/session_bus_address.user or using dui-run.

% commhistory-tool add -newgroup gabble/jabber/user1 friend@gmail.com 10
% commhistory-tool add -newgroup gabble/jabber/user2 another@jabber.org 10
...

where "gabble/jabber/..." is the local telepathy account and 10 is the
number of messages to create. Use listgroups and "add -group <id>" to
add new messages into an existing conversation.

"commhistory-tool deleteall" removes all messages and conversations from
the tracker database. For best results (i.e. to avoid weird sync
problems), kill all applications that use commhistory before deleteall
and restart afterwards.
